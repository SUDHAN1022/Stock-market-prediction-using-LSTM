# Stock-market-prediction-using-LSTM
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction using LSTM project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. With the power of deep learning, we aim to forecast stock prices and make informed investment decisions.

# Dataset
We use a publicly available dataset containing historical stock prices of various companies. The dataset includes features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. We preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and perform any necessary data transformations.

# Model Training
The LSTM model is built using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We employ techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting.

# Evalution and results
Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on the testing dataset. We compute various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy. We visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices to gain insights into the model's performance.

# Results
In this section, we present the results of our stock market prediction experiments. We discuss the model's performance, its strengths, limitations, and potential areas of improvement.
